## Overview
Portfolio website created to showcase photography work. Simple yet effective website to hero the work without distractions. The website consists of three main pages. An About page (index.html) with a short introduction, accompanied by a few sample images. A portfolio page to showcase the main body of work, sorted into three main types of work. Finally a contact page to get in touch for any work opportunities or to say hello!

##Files
**index.html :** About me page/homepage with a short introduction.
**portfolio.html :** Page containing the main body of work.
**contact.html :** For potential clients and stakeholders to get in touch via a contact form. 
**style.css :** File containing the main CSS elements to customise the website
**assets :** Folder to store all of the images used in the website

## Process
The design process was quite straightforward, with a clean minimal design style to hero the main body of work, to curate and showcase in the best way possible with minimal distractions. 

After the content was approved, I used bootstrapâ€™s grid system, navigation, and form to test my application quicker, to focus more on the design and usability or the website.

A footer was added and then later removed to improve the overall aesthetic of the website.
